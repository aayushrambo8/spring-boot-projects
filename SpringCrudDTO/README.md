# SpringCrudDTO

A Spring Boot application demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Spring Data JPA with a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.4.1**
- **Spring Web** (RESTful APIs)
- **Spring Data JPA** (Hibernate)
- **MySQL Connector/J** (Database connection)
- **Maven** (Dependency management and build tool)

## Functionalities

The application exposes a set of RESTful APIs to manage `Student` records via the `StudentController`. It extensively implements the DTO pattern (using `CreateStudentRequestDTO` and `CreateStudentResponseDTO`) to completely decouple the internal database entities from the API layer for creation, retrieval, and updating processes. Record timestamps (`createdAt` and `updatedAt`) are automatically managed by the application service during state changes.

Additionally, the project supports both **hard deletion** and **soft deletion** of records.

### API Testing (Bruno)
The project includes a ready-to-use API testing collection for [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/). The endpoints configuration files are conveniently located inside the `src/Bruno Endpoints` directory. You can import this folder directly into your Bruno client to quickly test all the CRUD APIs without needing to configure the requests manually.

### API Endpoints

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/student/create` | Creates a new student record using `CreateStudentRequestDTO`. Returns a `CreateStudentResponseDTO` upon success. |
| `GET` | `/api/student/get?id={id}` | Retrieves a specific active (non-deleted) student by their ID, mapping it to a `CreateStudentResponseDTO`. |
| `GET` | `/api/student/getAll` | Retrieves a list of all active students in the database, mapping them to `CreateStudentResponseDTO`s. |
| `PUT` | `/api/student/update?id={id}` | Updates the information of an existing active student using `CreateStudentRequestDTO`, returning a `CreateStudentResponseDTO`. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/student/delete?id={id}` | Permanently deletes a student record from the database (Hard Delete). |
| `DELETE` | `/api/student/deleteAll` | Permanently deletes all student records from the database. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/student/soft-delete?id={id}` | Marks a student record as deleted by setting a `deleted` flag to true (Soft Delete), hiding it from standard fetch queries. |

## Database Specification

- **Database**: MySQL (compatible with version 8.0+)
- **Schema**: A single `students` table.
- **Table `students` columns**:
  - `id` (BIGINT) – Primary Key, auto‑generated.
  - `first_name` (VARCHAR) – Student's first name.
  - `last_name` (VARCHAR) – Student's last name.
  - `email` (VARCHAR) – Unique email address.
  - `address` (VARCHAR) – Residential address.
  - `phone_no` (VARCHAR) – Contact phone number.
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) – Record creation timestamp.
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) – Record last update timestamp.
  - `deleted` (BOOLEAN) – Soft‑delete flag, defaults to `false`.
- **Indexes**: Primary key on `id`; unique constraint on `email`.
- **Soft Delete**: Records are not physically removed; setting `deleted` to `true` hides them from standard fetch queries.
- **Configuration**: Set the MySQL connection URL, username, and password in `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`).

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java 21 and Maven installed.
2. Ensure you have a running instance of MySQL.
3. Update the `application.properties` (or `.yml`) file inside `src/main/resources` with your MySQL database credentials (url, username, password).
4. Run the application using your IDE or via the command line:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
